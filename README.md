# dotfiles
Dotfiles and configs I use for my Void Linux setup.
## Stuff I use
- Window manager: dwm (uselessgaps, alpha)
- Compositor: Compton
- Editor: Vim
- Terminal: st (alpha)
- Theming: Pywal
- Shell : Bash
## Todo
- [ ] Fix alsa mute control with DWM in config.h (Possibly an issue with the statusbar displaying wrong).
- [ ] Get pywal to theme DWM borders and bar.
- [ ] Get transparency on unfocused windows only (Worked in arch by default).
- [ ] Implement inputting urls and maybe searching into dmenu
- [x] Post to desktop threads even though I'm not happy with it at all.
